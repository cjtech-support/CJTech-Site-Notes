CJ Tech Support Site Notes
I would like to transform the CJ Tech Support business from being known only as a computer support and networking business, to the small business marketing business that I have become. I spend more of my time each day helping with wordpress website support maintenance, web and email hosting than I do with fixing pc's.

My clients want the job taken out of their hands and just deal with the results. My business focus is now of getting results for my small business clients and the other websites that I own. By changing the focus of the business, I am hoping that the income will also then come from this new direction. Currently the majority of my income is still coming from pc and netork support.

Changes to happen for the CJ Tech Support Website.
Website: https://cjtech.com.au

I want the site to be a light, fast mobile friendly site focused on marketing content. Not PC support content.
There are a lot of SEO and Social Media business out there and I don't want to follow that generic marketing theme. I provide a full service for target audience.
