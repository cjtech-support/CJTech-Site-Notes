# CJ Tech Support – Site Notes

**CJ Tech Support** is transforming from a traditional PC support and networking business into a **results-driven small business marketing agency**.

While I still provide PC and network services, most of my time is now focused on:
- WordPress support and maintenance  
- Website creation and management  
- Cloud-based email and document hosting  
- Google Ads and Facebook PPC campaigns  
- SEO reporting and actionable marketing strategies

## 📌 The New Direction

My clients don't want dashboards and tools—they want results.

This business shift is about **removing technical stress** from small business owners and focusing on **high-impact digital services**. I'm re-aligning the CJ Tech brand to reflect this.

> **💡 Note:** While the majority of current income still comes from PC and network support, the new focus is on building long-term value through digital marketing services.
