# 🛠️ Infrastructure – CJ Tech Support

> "If you're running a small business, you shouldn't have to worry about domains, email, or hosting—I'll handle it for you."

Many of the small business owners I work with aren't technical—and they shouldn't have to be. My job is to make sure everything behind your website, email, and files works the way it should, so you can focus on your business.

## 🌐 Domains: Your Online Identity

Every website needs a domain name—like `yourbusiness.com.au`. I help you:

* Register a domain name (or manage the one you already own)
* Renew it each year so you don’t lose it
* Point it to your website and email properly

If you're not sure who owns your domain or where it's registered, I’ll help you track it down and take control.

## 🏡 Website Hosting: Where Your Site Lives

Think of hosting like the home for your website. It’s where all the files live and where people go when they type in your domain.

I use fast, secure hosting designed for WordPress websites:

* Automatic backups
* Regular software updates
* Speed optimisation for faster load times
* 99.9% uptime

You don’t need to worry about “cPanel” or control panels—I handle all the setup and maintenance.

## 📧 Email Hosting: Professional Communication

I can set up email addresses like `info@yourbusiness.com.au` so you look more professional than using a free Gmail or Hotmail account.

* Email works on your phone, laptop, or computer
* Spam filtering and syncing across devices
* Cloud-based so you don’t lose messages if your device breaks

Need shared calendars or cloud storage too? I can set that up with Google Workspace or other tools.

## ☁️ Cloud File Hosting: Work From Anywhere

I help businesses store their important documents securely online so the whole team can access them from anywhere:

* Setup of Google Drive or OneDrive
* Shared folders for staff
* Simple permission control (who can see or edit what)

You’ll never lose files again due to a crashed computer.

## 🧰 You Don’t Have to Manage It

I know most business owners don’t want to deal with technical emails or DNS settings. That’s what I’m here for:

* I explain things in plain English
* I take care of the setup and the problems
* I keep everything running and secure

Whether you're just getting online or already have a setup that needs fixing, I can make it work better.
